# user-pass-maker
Make username:password combos then remove duplicates

Be sure to change usernames and passwords to what you want them to be.
Also change the second [] to the amount of users/passwords you have.
Finally change the %13 and %12 to the amount of users/passwords you have.
All of this is in gen.c
